## JobCatalogue

**Fullstack code i.e ` Spring boot + react js `.**

**Steps to Run**
1. Clone the code into some directory say `/home/username/path/JobCatalogue`
1. Go to the project directory `cd /home/username/path/JobCatalogue`
1. Run maven build `mvn clean install` (Skip tests)
1. Run the spring boot code `mvn spring-boot:run`

The above step should boot up the spring app on `http://localhost:8085` 

**Significance  of various folder**

Basically its a generated Apring Boot rest application. We will be using `src/main/resources/static`
folder for the comiled React code.

*Folders*
* react_code : Conains a basic react app that is generated using `create-react-app` npm module.
  1. npm i create-react-app
  1. npx create-react-app my-app
* react_code/dist: Contains the compiled code generated by the react app 
  1. npm run build
* src/main/resources/static: Contains the compile code copied from the `react_code/dist`
  1. check `copy-resources` in pom.xml file


**Buld steps in `pom.xml`**

We have use the maven-exec-plugin to facilitate the react build process.

1. Step `NPM install` does the `NPM install` command on react_app folder to get all dependencies
1. Step `NPM build` does the code compile and puts it in `react_code/dist` folder
1. TO DO `clean resources` need to emoty the static folder before the step 2 executes.
